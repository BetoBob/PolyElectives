# PolyElectives

__Purpose:__ group project for CSC 307 Introduction to Software Engineering

__Summary:__ PolyElectives is a JavaFX quiz application designed to help Cal Poly students choose tech-electives based off their interests. Tech-elective information is stored in a list of questions (formatted txt file) and a list of tech electives with scoring attributes (CSV file). The source files in this repository include questions and tech electives geared towards Computer Science students. The system associates users' responses with 'tags' (areas of interests/fields of study) which are used as a metric to rank tech electives. Quiz results can be saved if a user creates an account.

For a general outline of the code, view _PolyElectivesClassDiagram.pdf_.
